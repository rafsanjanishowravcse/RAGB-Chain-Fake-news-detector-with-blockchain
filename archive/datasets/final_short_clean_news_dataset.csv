REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"BANGKOK: A pro-democracy movement led by student groups has gathered pace across Thailand for the last couple of months, with some activists openly calling for reforms of the kingdoms unassailable monarchy.Tens of thousands have turned out this weekend for a show of force in Bangkok, defying warnings from the premier that the nation could be engulfed in flames if they push too far.Here is what we know:The protesters are rallying against the government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha.The former army chief led a coup in 2014 and kept the kingdom under military rule for five years.Under the junta, a new constitution was drafted before elections were held last year.Prayut was voted in to lead a civilian government -- a win analysts say was tilted by the new charters provisions.Protesters say the whole process was a stitch-up and are calling for parliament to be dissolved, the constitution rewritten and an end to the harassment they are facing.They also have a list of 10 demands for the monarchy, including throwing out a defamation law that shields the powerful royal family from criticism.The law is one of the harshest in the world, carrying a jail sentence of up to 15 years per charge.Discontent has been simmering since February when the leaders of an opposition party, popular among young people, were banned from politics.Many protesters say the move against the Future Forward Party was politically motivated.A pandemic lockdown, which sent Thailands economy into freefall, exposed the chasm between the billionaire class and the poor.In June, prominent activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in self-exile in neighbouring Cambodia , then disappeared.Thailands social media-savvy activists lit up Twitter with their demands for answers.The online campaign spilled offline mid-July and a wave of protests across the country started, with up to 30,000 turning out this weekend at the biggest rally since the 2014 coup.True, Thailand has seen a spin-cycle of violent street protests and military coups over the decades.But in the past the protest movements had vast financial and political clout behind them.Todays student demonstrators say there is no single leader -- a strategy partly inspired by the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.Daring to take on the taboo topic of the monarchy is also a first.Under the constitution, the royals -- including the super-rich King Maha Vajiralongkorn -- are supposed to stay out of politics, but they wield enormous clout.Since the king took the throne in 2016, he has made unprecedented changes, taking direct control of the palaces fortune and moving two army units under his command.At his side are the arch-royalist military and powerful billionaire clans.Mixed. The student-led protests have drawn support from a broad demographic, including many from the working class.The movement has also spread to high schools across the country with teenagers tying white bows of solidarity in their hair and on backpacks.But pro-royalist groups have held their own, smaller counter-demonstrations with mostly older protesters enraged at the perceived affront to the monarchy.Army chief Apirat Kongsompong has ominously warned that hatred of the nation is an incurable disease.Prayut has said Thailand would be engulfed in flames if the students push too hard, though he vowed softer measures against the weekends protesters.So far, more than two dozen protesters have been arrested, charged with sedition and breaking coronavirus rules, and released on bail.Hard to predict.By tackling the monarchy, Paul Chambers of Naresuan University says the protesters have effectively forced the genie out of the bottle.Historians -- and even the student leaders themselves -- have raised the spectre of a previous student-led movement.That ended in October 1976 in what became known as the Thammasat University massacre Students protesting against the return of a military dictator were shot, beaten to death and lynched by state forces and royalist mobs.Matt Wheeler of International Crisis Group points to the clear pattern of the state using deadly force against pro-democracy protesters.So much is at stake for those who benefit from the status quo that it would be imprudent to rule it out, he told AFP.But Thailands scrutiny by Western allies means using force would not be an option this time, surmises Titipol Phakdeewanich, political analyst at Ubon Ratchathani University.If they crack down and students die, that would be the end to the militarys legitimacy."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"BHUBANESWAR: With the state government initiating the process of preparing the supplementary budget for 2020-21 financial year, the finance department has decided to allocate states share under various centrally-sponsored schemes (CSSs) in accordance with the allocation made by the Union government.Since it has been noticed that the actual allocation by the Union government under various CSSs varies from the provision made in the annual budget, it has been decided that the state share of the the CSSs should be increased or decreased proportionately, said an official source in the finance department.Various departments implementing the CSSs have been asked to submit proposal for additional allocation as state share in the supplementary budget only if the level of central assistance communicated by the ministry concerned is higher than that mentioned in the annual budget 2020-21.Similarly, where there is a reduction in allocation by the Centre , there should be equivalent reduction in the state share, said a finance department officer.Centrally-sponsored schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is likely to receive higher allocation from the Centre as the Union government has been emphasising on creation of additional jobs in rural areas. Higher allocation is also expected under the National Food Security Act . In case some new CSSs have been launched by the Centre, for which provisions were not made in the annual budget, various state government departments have been asked to submit proposals accordingly to make financial provision in the supplementary budget, said the official.With the state government already deciding not to launch any new scheme as part of the expenditure rationalisation measures, the finance department has already clarified that the supplementary budget will have no provision for any new scheme by any department except the health and family welfare department taking into account the Covid pandemic.If any new scheme is essentially required for emergent public services by any other department, such schemes can be taken up only after concurrence of the finance department.The supplementary budget will be tabled in the state assembly in the winter session that is likely to be held in November-December, said an official source.The decision to increase or decrease the states share for central schemes has been taken due to resource crunch in view of the Covid-induced lockdown and shutdown.The state government has recorded around 23% deficit in collection of revenue in the April-June quarter."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening. Much to our surprise, we saw terrorists emerging out from underground in the middle of the stream, which generally has water gushing only in the rainy season, he said.Five terrorists belonging to banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were killed after the troops launched an attack earlier this year."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

We have had two tough tests in which weve fallen behind after missing chances and had goals ruled out.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening. Much to our surprise, we saw terrorists emerging out from underground in the middle of the stream, which generally has water gushing only in the rainy season, he said.Five terrorists belonging to banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were killed after the troops launched an attack earlier this year."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara.

REAL,"LOS ANGELES: This years ferocious wildfires on the US West Coast are taking a heavy toll on exhausted firefighters who see no end in sight to the blazes, with the coronavirus pandemic adding another layer of risk.For Darrell Roberts , a 20-year veteran firefighter in California, the more than two dozen major wildfires raging across the state and the unprecedented scale of the blazes are a stark reminder of climate change and the new normal.When resources are stripped thin and literally every firefighter is out on the frontlines, and you have firefighters coming from all over the US and other countries, we know that were in unprecedented waters, Roberts, 42, told AFP after a three-week deployment on the frontlines. We havent seen fires like this before.The severity of the ongoing blazes -- which have devoured more than five million acres in California, Oregon and Washington state and killed more than 30 people -- has tested the limits of traditional firefighting techniques and pushed crews to the point of exhaustion, he said.But while the intense heat and unpredictable flames are known enemies for firefighters, adding to the challenge this year is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has further stretched resources.Covid is already a high concern in our day-to-day operations, when were not involved in fighting fires, and now were combining both, Roberts said. And thats put a tremendous amount of stress and strain on firefighters, because our job is to save lives, but we now also have to protect ourselves.He said fire officials have had to adjust the layout at fire base camps to reduce the risk of spread, and many firefighters have resorted to bringing their own tents for added security.Our last seven days out fighting the fires, we literally slept out in tents camping, said Roberts, a father of two teenagers who is battalion chief at his fire station in Chula Vista, located in southern California.So imagine, youve been out fighting a fire for 24 to 36 hours, its hot with temperatures well above 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) and youre coming back to a tent to get some rest before going out again, he said.Another issue is the fact that some of the major blazes raging in California since mid-August are burning in rugged and remote country, requiring firefighters to drive or walk several hours to reach them and the same amount of time to go back to base after a grueling shift.Many spend much of their rest period repairing tools and other equipment before heading out again to combat the flames.Roberts said crews rely mostly on each other for support while out on the frontlines, and also have access to professional help to cope with the death and destruction they witness and to maintain a semblance of normalcy with their families back home.We had a captain on a crew during one of the fires this summer calling home because his wife and two young daughters had to determine how to put down one of their beloved pets that was dying, he said.When spouses and kids are getting sick, anniversaries, birthdays, we cant always be there, he added."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"BHUBANESWAR: With the state government initiating the process of preparing the supplementary budget for 2020-21 financial year, the finance department has decided to allocate states share under various centrally-sponsored schemes (CSSs) in accordance with the allocation made by the Union government.Since it has been noticed that the actual allocation by the Union government under various CSSs varies from the provision made in the annual budget, it has been decided that the state share of the the CSSs should be increased or decreased proportionately, said an official source in the finance department.Various departments implementing the CSSs have been asked to submit proposal for additional allocation as state share in the supplementary budget only if the level of central assistance communicated by the ministry concerned is higher than that mentioned in the annual budget 2020-21.Similarly, where there is a reduction in allocation by the Centre , there should be equivalent reduction in the state share, said a finance department officer.Centrally-sponsored schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is likely to receive higher allocation from the Centre as the Union government has been emphasising on creation of additional jobs in rural areas. Higher allocation is also expected under the National Food Security Act . In case some new CSSs have been launched by the Centre, for which provisions were not made in the annual budget, various state government departments have been asked to submit proposals accordingly to make financial provision in the supplementary budget, said the official.With the state government already deciding not to launch any new scheme as part of the expenditure rationalisation measures, the finance department has already clarified that the supplementary budget will have no provision for any new scheme by any department except the health and family welfare department taking into account the Covid pandemic.If any new scheme is essentially required for emergent public services by any other department, such schemes can be taken up only after concurrence of the finance department.The supplementary budget will be tabled in the state assembly in the winter session that is likely to be held in November-December, said an official source.The decision to increase or decrease the states share for central schemes has been taken due to resource crunch in view of the Covid-induced lockdown and shutdown.The state government has recorded around 23% deficit in collection of revenue in the April-June quarter."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."
REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening.

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening. Much to our surprise, we saw terrorists emerging out from underground in the middle of the stream, which generally has water gushing only in the rainy season, he said.Five terrorists belonging to banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were killed after the troops launched an attack earlier this year."
REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening. Much to our surprise, we saw terrorists emerging out from underground in the middle of the stream, which generally has water gushing only in the rainy season, he said.Five terrorists belonging to banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were killed after the troops launched an attack earlier this year."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

In such cases where wearing masks is not advisable, alternative measures will have to be taken such as speaking over phone or by sitting at a distance which can be audible and understood by the candidates, the court said.Now, claiming that the government has failed to implement the directions of the court to ensure safety of such students, the petitioner has moved the present review application.The order passed did not take into consideration specific risks faced by children with disabilities and the fact that the authorities have not taken any action to protect the rights of these children, the petitioner said.The court has also failed to take into account the fact that boards like CBSE, NIOS have specifically exempted children with disabilities from writing examinations as they are at high risk and cannot write exams safely during the pandemic, he added."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019.

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

And now with three ODIs a series, 300 ODIs is a dream for anybody to play.Du Plessis smashed six boundaries in his 44-ball stay including a 115-run partnership with 34-year-old Ambati Rayudu, who hit 71, to help the three-time IPL winners chase the target with four balls to spare.Englands Sam Curran smashed 18 off six balls after the 22-year-old all-rounder was sent ahead of Dhoni in a move that surprised many.But Currans hitting affirmed Dhonis faith in him.Thats one thing we havent done, Dhoni said, referring to experimenting with the batting order."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening. Much to our surprise, we saw terrorists emerging out from underground in the middle of the stream, which generally has water gushing only in the rainy season, he said.Five terrorists belonging to banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen were killed after the troops launched an attack earlier this year."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.Of this, as per Centres calculation, shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states revenues.The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019. The Centre had to dive into the excess cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 to pay the states.The Centre had released over Rs 1.65 lakh crore in 2019-20 as GST compensation."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Indias total external debt increased by 2.8 per cent to $558.5 billion at the end of March mainly on account of a rise in commercial borrowings, according to a report released by the finance ministry.The external debt stood at $543 billion at end-March 2019.The ratio of foreign currency reserves to external debt stood at 85.5 per cent as at end-March 2020, as compared to 76.0 per cent a year ago, the report said.External debt as a ratio to GDP rose marginally to 20.6 per cent as at end-March 2020 from 19.8 per cent a year ago, Indias External Debt: A Status Report: 2019-2020 showed.Compared to end-March 2019, sovereign debt shrank 3 per cent to reach $100.9 billion, it said, adding, this decrease was primarily due to a fall in FII investment in G-Sec the second largest constituent by 23.3 per cent to $21.6 billion from $28.3 billion a year ago.Loans from multilateral and bilateral sources under external assistance the largest constituent of the sovereign debt grew 4.9 per cent to $87.2 billion, it said.Non-sovereign debt, on the other hand, it said, rose 4.2 per cent to $457.7 billion mainly due to an increase in commercial borrowings the largest constituent by 6.7 per cent to $220.3 billion. Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

Outstanding NRI deposits the second largest constituent at $130.6 billion was almost equal to the level a year ago, it said.In most emerging markets, as the economy expands, foreign debt typically accumulates to address shortage of domestic savings, India is no exception to this phenomenon.Economic activity in India influences the accumulation of external debt, reflecting the policy over the years of enabling private sector to access foreign debt and this was reflecting as stock of non-sovereign debt (private sector debt) is four times that of the sovereign debt at end-March 2020.Further, it said, non-financial corporations are the biggest debtors, accounting for 42 per cent of total debt, followed by deposit-taking corporations (28.3 per cent), and general government (18.1 per cent).However, as the momentum of economic activity slowed in 2019-20, the private sectors appetite to access foreign debt ebbed, resulting in relatively lower growth of 6.7 per cent in the stock of commercial borrowings as at end-March 2020 when compared to that recorded during the first five years of the previous decade.The report observed that the stock of NRI deposits as at end-March 2020, being almost equal to the level recorded on March 31, 2019, needs to be seen in the context of, among others, softening of interest rates on NRI deposits.About 81 per cent of the total stock of external debt is long-term, i.e., having maturity of greater than one year, predominately in the form of commercial borrowings and NRI deposits, it said.Remaining 19 per cent of debt is short-term, primarily in the form of short-term trade credit. Short-term trade credit, constituting about 95 per cent of the total short-term debt, is used for financing imports.Noting that the US dollar is the predominant currency for denomination of Indias external debt with a share of 53.7 per cent of the total debt as at end-March 2020, it said, the US dollar appreciation as on March 31 this year over the level a year ago resulted in a valuation gain of $16.6 billion.In other words, it said, excluding these valuation gains, increase in Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 over the level a year ago would have been $32 billion.Thus, moderation in accumulation of Indias external debt as at end-March 2020 reflected, among others, slowing economic activity and appreciating US dollar.Going forward, the report said as the economic activity in India gathers pace and gains traction, stock of external debt would increase.However, there does not appear to be any cause for concern given the benign level of debt vulnerability and rising domestic savings would counter-balance the imperative of accessing foreign debt.Thus, while augmenting growth would lead to foreign debt levels increasing, rising savings would moderate such rise in foreign debt levels, it said."

REAL,"NEW DELHI: Companies having not less than 300 workers will soon be allowed to hire and fire workers without seeking prior government permission, with the labour ministry proposing changes to rules in a bill introduced in Lok Sabha on Saturday.The proposal, which was the bone of contention between the ministry and trade unions, is part of the Industrial Relation Code Bill 2020.Currently, only those industrial establishments with less than 100 employees are permitted to hire and fire their staff without permission of the government.The bill was introduced by labour minister Santosh Gangwar amid opposition from Congress and few other parties.The Industrial Relation Code Bill 2019 was introduced in Lok Sabha last year and subsequently sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. This bill was withdrawn on Saturday.An earlier draft bill circulated by the labour ministry for discussion had also proposed the criteria that companies having not less than 300 employees can hire and fire without the governments permission. However, this provision faced stiff opposition from trade unions and was not included in the 2019 bill.Earlier this year, the Parliamentary committee also made a case of allowing companies having less than 300 workers to go for retrenchment of staff or closure without government permission.States like Rajasthan have already increased the threshold to 300 workers, which according to the labour ministry has resulted in an increase in employment and a decrease in retrenchment, the committee had pointed out in its report.With regard to the threshold, the government has proposed Section 77(1) in the The Industrial Relation Code 2020.According to the Section, the provisions of this Chapter (lay-off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishment) shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than three hundred workers, or such higher number of workers as may be notified by the appropriate Government, were employed on an average per working day in the preceding twelve months.Apart from this code, two others- Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code On Social Security, 2020- were also introduced by the minister in Lok Sabha.Among others, Congress leaders- Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor- opposed the introduction of the three bills.Tewari noted these three bills are fundamentally changed versions of their earlier forms and urged the minister to withdraw them and hold wider consultations before introducing them.These bills are also a blow to the rights of workers, he added.With respect to the industrial relations code, Tharoor said it severely restricts the right of workers to strike and also allows state or central governments to amend the threshold for applicability relating to layoffs and retrenchment.In Lok Sabha, Gangwar said that over 29 labour laws have been merged into four codes and that one of them has already been passed.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was passed by Parliament last year.Gangwar noted that the government engaged in wider consultations over these bills with various stakeholders and that more than 6,000 comments were received online on the bills.These bills were later sent to a standing committee and 174 of its 233 recommendations have been accepted, the minister said."

REAL,"SHOPIAN: Hideouts in higher reaches and seeking refuge in local houses are a thing of the past as terrorists in Kashmir valley now dig underground bunkers in dense orchards and even in seasonal streams to escape the dragnet of army and security forces.This trend has been witnessed off late in twin districts of Pulwama and Shopian with the latter having a majority of them in view of dense apple orchards and jungles, says Colonel A K Singh, heading the 44 Rashtriya Rifles , the armys counter-insurgent unit which earned a distinction of having maximum kills of terrorists as well as surrenders or apprehensions.Talking to PTI from the well-fortified 44-RR headquarters, Col Singh and his team is always seen engaging with locals to sort out their problems which may even include career counselling or guidance in education but when it comes to countering terrorists, they are much ahead by neutralising 47 militants and ensuring detentions and surrender of seven of them.For Col Singh and his team, who man two areas of Shopian and three of Pulwama districts, both considered to be hotbeds of militancy, the task has not been easy after recovery of underground bunkers where terrorists could hide for several days without being noticed by the security forces.The shocker was a hideout in the middle of Rambi Ara, known for fluctuating water levels and often affected by flash floods, that led Col Singh and his team members back to the drawing board.The terrorists were hiding inside an iron bunker made in the middle of Rambi Ara. The alert troops saw an opening of an empty oil barrel which was subsequently used by terrorists to enter into the bunker.This was something worth suspicion and discreet surveillance was mounted on the opening.
